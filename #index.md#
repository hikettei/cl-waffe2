> __⚠️ cl-waffe2 is still in the concept stage and has a limited feature. Also, things are subject to change. DO NOT USE CL-WAFFE2 IN YOUR PRODUCT.__

cl-waffe2 provides a set of differentiable matrix operations which is aimed to apply to build neural network models on Common Lisp.

The primary concepts and goals of this project is following:

1. `Do not run until the node is optimized.`, that is, Lazy-Evaluation first.

2. Generic operations powered by multiple kinds of user-defined backends.

3. defined-and-run, closer to defined-by-run APIs.


**Everything in this documentation is still incomplete! I guess should be much more polished!**

#

## What's next?

1. [Install cl-waffe2](./install)

2. [Learn the concepts with practical tutorials](./overview)

3. [Visit some examples! (Not yet ready...)](./examples)
